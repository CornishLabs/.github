Here we host code that is used internally in labs of the Simon Cornish at Durham university. The labs focus on neutral atoms (Rb, Cs, Yb) that are cooled to quantum degeneracy, and then typically associated into molecular species (RbCs, CsYb).
*This code is typically not intended for public consumption*, that code typically lives in our wider [Quantum Light and Matter (QLM)](https://durham-qlm.uk/) group's [Github](https://github.com/durham-qlm/).

Please do not contact us for support requests on code that lives in these repositories.
We choose to make these repositories accessible to the wider public (in the cases that we do) as we believe it beneficial for people to see how APIs of typical lab devices are used - not that we claim to use them correctly in all cases...
